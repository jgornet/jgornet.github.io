	  <h2>How can we better understand the underlying mechanisms
	  in neural systems and neurological diseases?</h2>
	  <p>
	    While the chemical and genetic composition of many
	  neurological phenomena—such as learning and memory—have been
	  largely uncovered, a thorough understanding of the
	  mechanisms in these phenomena has been elusive. This can be
	  partially attributed to the lack of technology necessary to
	  study and understand these aspects. Nevertheless, an
	  understanding of the underlying mechanisms in biological
	  phenomena is becoming increasingly important for
	  understanding the neural system and designing targeted
	  treatments for diseases such as Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s,
	  and ALS.
	  </p>
	  
	  <p>
	    James Gornet is interested in using his background in
	    biomedical engineering and chemistry to gain a deeper
	    understanding of how different neurological processes
	    occur and how diseases can perturb these processes. More
	    specifically, James Gornet draws from experience in
	    machine learning, computer vision, materials chemistry,
	    and molecular biology to tackle these questions.
